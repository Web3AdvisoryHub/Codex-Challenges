# 🧬 Codex Challenges

**Solidity by Fire. Lore by Fork. Welcome to the Codex.**

This is not just a repository.  
This is a ritual.

Inside these folders are 32 challenges—each one tied to a chapter in the *Web3 Sci-Fi Codex*.  
Every contract echoes a choice, every bug masks a truth, and every fix unlocks a deeper piece of the chain.

If you're here, you're already part of it.

## 🧪 How This Works

Each chapter of the book introduces a logic flaw, a mechanic, or a hidden vulnerability.  
Your job? Spot it. Fix it. Fork it. Evolve it.

You'll find:
- 🗂 One folder per chapter  
- 📜 Solidity files with bugs, exploits, or incomplete logic  
- 🧠 Lore embedded as comments  
- 🛠️ Bonus quests buried in some chapters (*not marked—only remembered*)
