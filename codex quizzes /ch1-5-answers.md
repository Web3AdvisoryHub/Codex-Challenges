**Answer Key: Quiz 1 (Chapters 1–5)**

---

### **1. Kismet’s Coin Glitch**  
**Suggested Interpretation:**  
The coin is a narrative symbol of *quantum indeterminacy* and choice. Its third face — Kismet’s own reflection — suggests identity is the variable, not just the outcome.

---

### **2. Ghost Contract Transaction**  
**Correct Understanding:**  
These are **phantom executions**. The contract logs success, but no state changes occur. They act as *haunting metadata*, often used to mask covert behavior or deny liability.

---

### **3. Loyalty Clause Logic**  
**Danger Level:**  
5 – Extremely risky. Loyalty clauses coded as `require(loyaltyScore >= x)` can **exclude dissent**, enforce **compliance over clarity**, and create **consensus autocracies**.

---

### **4. Reflective Wallet Addressing**  
**Correct Insight:**  
When wallets reflect identities not their own (e.g., mirrors in Ch.2 and Ch.3), this symbolizes **digital self-spoofing**. A world where proving "you are you" is more dangerous than not trying at all.

### **5. DAO Judiciary Trap**  
**Best Strategy:**  
- Fork to form **parallel truth channels**  
- Encode **opt-out pathways** in initial contracts  
- Push for **ZK oversight** — secrecy with cryptographic verifiability
