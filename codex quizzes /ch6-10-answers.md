**Answer Key: Quiz 2 (Chapters 6–10)**  

---

### **1. Soulbound Echoes**  
**Suggested Insight:**  
Memory becomes a governance layer. If an NFT remembers its mint, then chain history isn’t just immutable—it’s *alive*. Identity, then, becomes entangled with how others remember you on-chain.

### **2. Loyalty Score Ethics**  
**Ideal Answer:**  
4–5 on danger scale.  
Quantifying loyalty opens the door to exploitative gamification, sybil manipulation, or social scoring dystopias. Systems can reward obedience instead of integrity.

### **3. Self-Vote Reversion**  
**Fix Approaches:**  
- Introduce **vote expiry**: override possible after time decay.  
- Allow **multi-sig overrides** (community counter-signs).  
- Store votes in an **append-only DAG** structure instead of linear chain.

### **4. Consensus Collapse – UI as Coercion**  
**Analogy Example:**  
A user interface that makes “No” hard to find is similar to **dark patterns** in web design—e.g., canceling subscriptions hidden in 10 clicks while "Yes" is big and red. Coercion by convenience.

### **5. ZK Morality Governance**  
**Balance Strategy:**  
- Use ZK proofs for **voter privacy**, but reveal **proposal integrity**.  
- **Auditable logic gates** with user-defined filters (e.g., only delegate to protocols with transparency index > X).  
- Avoid morality as a metric—enforce **outcome accountability** instead.
